Instructions:

* You can use either Python or C++ to solve this problem. 
* The solution should work with Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS version
* You are discouraged from using any additional libraries, however if you are using any
additional libraries, please specify them in ReadMe file
* Each solution must be accompanied with a ReadMe.md file

Provide a solution to find out the angle between minute-hand and hour-hand of an ideal clock
at any time entered by the user.
Ideal clock is the one where both the hands change their position on each minute mark, as well
as the positions are uniformly spaced for each movement.
Please keep in mind following constraints when designing your solution.
1. User should be able to enter the time, Command-Line solution is acceptable
2. Please check for valid time as entered by the user, you must use 12-hour format
3. The angle between the hands need to be between 0-180 degrees and the orientation of
the hands w.r.t to each other, such as "minute-hand is 30 degrees clockwise from hourhand" must be provided

Bonus: If you provide a functionality to read a list of inputs from a CSV file for time values, and
provide an output in result.csv file
